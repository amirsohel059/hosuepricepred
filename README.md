## Overview
This repository contains a data science project for predicting house prices. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the selling prices of houses based on various features. Predicting house prices can be useful for real estate agents, homebuyers, and sellers to make informed decisions.

## Project Pipeline
### Handling Missing Data
- Identify columns with NaN (null) values in both the training and test datasets.
- Replace NaN values with alternate meaningful values where applicable.
- Impute missing values using either mean or mode, depending on the feature distribution.

### Data Cleaning
- Remove duplicate values from both the training and test datasets.
- Check for correct and plausible data entries in both datasets to ensure data quality.

### Data Integration
- Combine both the training and test datasets into a single dataframe for further processing.

### Feature Selection
- Ensure no multicollinearity exists between independent features.
- Use all available features for model training.

### Handling Skewed Data
- Identify skewed independent features.
- Apply log transformation to the skewed features.
- Apply log transformation to the target feature.

### Text Data to Numerical Conversion
- Convert text data into numerical data using the dummy variables method (one-hot encoding).

### Data Splitting
- Split the data into training, testing, and validation datasets to facilitate model evaluation.

### Feature Scaling
- Apply feature scaling, such as standardization or normalization, to the independent features (X_train, X_test, X_valid).

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models. This was done in Google Colab due to resource constraints.

### Model Training
- Train the machine learning models using the best hyperparameters obtained from the tuning process.

## Notes
- This README provides an overview of the project pipeline, but each step may have its own detailed documentation or Jupyter Notebook in the project directory.
- Ensure that all dependencies and libraries required for the project are properly installed.
